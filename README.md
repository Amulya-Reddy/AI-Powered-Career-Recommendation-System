# AI-Powered-Career-Recommendation-System  

## **Project Overview**  
This is an **AI-driven career recommendation system** built with **Machine Learning, Spring Boot, and AWS**. The system analyzes user **skills, experience, and industry trends** to suggest the most suitable career paths.  

## **Key Features**  
- **AI-based job role predictions** based on skills and experience  
- **Industry insights**, including job demand and market trends  
- **Spring Boot backend** for efficient API management  
- **AWS deployment** for scalability and cloud integration  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Machine Learning** for career predictions  
- **Spring Boot** for backend development  
- **AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)** for cloud deployment  
- **MySQL** for database management  
- **React/HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for frontend (if applicable)  

## **Setup Instructions**  

### **Prerequisites**  
- **Java 17+** installed  
- **Spring Boot** setup  
- **AWS account** for cloud services  
- **Python 3.12+** for Machine Learning models  

### **Installation Steps**  
#### **Backend (Spring Boot)**  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Navigate to the backend directory  
3. Build the project using Maven  
4. Run the Spring Boot application  

#### **Machine Learning Model**  
1. Navigate to the ML directory  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Run the model  

#### **Deployment on AWS**  
- **AWS EC2**: Hosts the backend  
- **AWS S3**: Stores static files  
- **AWS RDS (MySQL)**: Manages the database  

## **How It Works**  
1. **User inputs** skills and experience level.  
2. **Machine Learning model** processes the data to suggest career options.  
3. **Spring Boot API** serves recommendations to the frontend.  
4. **AWS services** handle hosting and scalability.
